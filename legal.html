      and your "now playing" game status, if you use these features.
    </li>
    <li>
      Follower and following relationships (who you follow and who follows
      you), which are only visible to logged-in users and are not shared
      with third parties.
    </li>
    <li>
      Anonymous usage data, such as game likes, dislikes, and game
      popularity statistics.
    </li>
    <li>
      YouTube API interaction data if you use our video features (e.g.
      video playback, or embedded content).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Use of YouTube API Services</h3>
  <p>
    Our site uses YouTube API Services to power some features, such as
    embedded video content or simplified YouTube playback experiences. By
    using these features, you are agreeing to the
    <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >YouTube Terms of Service</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your use of YouTube through our services is also subject to the
    <a
      href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >Google Privacy Policy</a
    >.
  </p>

  <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our services.</li>
    <li>
      Display your username, avatar, and bio on your public profile
      (unless you set your profile to private).
    </li>
    <li>
      Show your online status, last active time, and now playing status to
      other users, according to your privacy settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enable social features such as following, followers, and mutual
      friend indicators.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let friends join your game sessions if you have your status public.
    </li>
    <li>Respond to your inquiries or feedback.</li>
    <li>Ensure the security and functionality of the platform.</li>
    <li>
      Understand which games or content are popular, using only aggregated
      and anonymous data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Profile Privacy and Status Visibility</h3>
  <p>
    You can control the visibility of your profile, online status, last
    active time, and now playing status in your account settings. If you
    set your profile to private, your avatar will be blurred to others,
    your bio will show "This profile is private," and following will be
    disabled.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also choose who can see your online and last active status:
    everyone, only mutual followers, or no one. When set to “mutual
    followers,” only users who follow you and are followed back by you can
    see your activity.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Friends and Social Features</h3>
<p>
  Starship includes optional social features that allow you to connect with other users. 
  These features include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Becoming “friends” by mutually following another user. Friendship is only established 
    when both users follow each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Seeing when your friends were last online or active, depending on each user’s privacy 
    settings. You can choose to make this visible to everyone, only friends, or no one.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allowing friends to join your active game sessions or parties, if you enable 
    people to view your status in your privacy settings. You can change this setting at any time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Friends cannot see your private profile details or join your games unless you have 
    chosen to enable these options.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All friend-related features can be disabled or restricted through your account privacy 
  settings at any time.
</p>
